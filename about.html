        My name's Vidhya Kudikyala and I'm a third year undergraduate student studying a Bachelor of Design, majoring in Digital Technologies at the University of Melbourne. My skills currently lie in user interface and user experience design which includes creating sketches, wireframes and prototypes, alongside user testing practices including interviews an surveys. In addition to this some of my other skills lie in HTML AND CSS, which I use for basic front end development of website applications. I'm constantly working towards improving my techniques, and furthering my skillset through different opportunities and experiences. I take pride in my studies and hope to become a UI/UX designer in the future.
